Features:
    O Update autoencoder architecture with more stable model
        o Transfer and adapt code from https://github.com/CompVis/iin/blob/master/iin/models/ae.py
        o Test usability of code on this project

Experiments:
    X Manually edit delta vector and observe changes
        - Observe changes
    X After learning the delta vector, threshold values > 1 to 1 and < -1 to -1, and others to 0
        - Switched task to pass the z-change vector through a sigmoid to obtain this result.
        - Observe changes
