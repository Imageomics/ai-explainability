# Class-Conditional Variational Autoencoder

This repository contains an implementation of the Class-Conditional Variational Autoencoder (Class-CVAE) model. This incorporates class information in the latent space, which enables image generation conditioned on specific classes.

The goal of this project is to associate singular dimensions of the latent space to human understandable/semantic parts important for image classification.
